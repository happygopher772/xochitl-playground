    Gambling project sounds fun, maybe I could get some practice
    and an overview over the graphic and animation world...
    enriching...

  random
    PRNG, uses things such as device time, whatever, to derive
    seed, takes it through an algorithm. Can be replicated with
    same seed, fast, not as secure, think minecraft seeds.

  secrets
    cryptography, instead of easy seeds, more randomized methods,
    difficult to replicate, idk, more secure.

    I have to put my current classes into real world practice, dive
    deeper into the theory behind crytography, make use of
    discreet maths for computer science.

    Now I get to see first hand why game engines are necessary,
    tinker could not handle multiple sounds and icon updates.
    And again, I see much abstraction there is, so much to coding and
    surrounding fields, I want to do it all, understand it all, but there
    is just too much, sound engine, os, idk... hopefully getting an overview
    of it all will be enough, still not sure what I want to do. Coding this
    basic loot box was fun though, I'll check out pygame next.
