    Gambling project sounds fun, maybe I could get some practice
    and an overview over the graphic and animation world...
    enriching...

  random
    PRNG, uses things such as device time, whatever, to derive
    seed, takes it through an algorithm. Can be replicated with
    same seed, fast, not as secure, think minecraft seeds.

  secrets
    cryptography, instead of easy seeds, more randomized methods,
    difficult to replicate, idk, more secure.

    I have to put my current classes into real world practice, dive
    deeper into the theory behind crytography, make use of
    discreet maths for computer science.
